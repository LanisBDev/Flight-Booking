# Basic Flight Reservation System (C++)

This was one of my first C++ projectsâ€”a simple, console-based flight reservation system that simulates booking international flights originating from Nashville, TN.

## Key Features

- Book from a list of predetermined flights
- Enter customer details and generate a flight ticket
- Store and retrieve customer data using file handling
- Simple, user-friendly console input/output
- Basic error handling and input validation

## Technologies Used

- C++
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File I/O
- Console UI

## Purpose of this project

This project was built early in my computer science journey to help me practice fundamental programming concepts like classes, file handling, and user input. While basic, it laid the groundwork for future work in more complex systems and structured software development.
